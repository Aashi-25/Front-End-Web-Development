    <p>As a second-year B.Tech student specializing in Computer Science, I’m diving into foundational coursework like programming, algorithms, and data structures. I enjoy hands-on projects and labs, collaborating with my peers, and participating in coding competitions. I’m particularly interested in areas like artificial intelligence and web development, and I’m eager to apply my knowledge through internships and real-world applications.</p>
